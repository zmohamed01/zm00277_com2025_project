Description of site: This site is a Module Selection site where students can login and 
select the available modules for the next academic year. There is a 'Module Information' 
page where anyone can search module codes for further information about the module. 
There is a 'Selections' drop-down menu where student users can make new selections 
(up to 60 credits) and view, edit or delete any of their own selections. Admin users can view 
all student selections and approve them (if the student's reason for choosing is sufficient)
but cannot edit/delete student selections. Only people that have signed up to the site are 
able to continue to selections. There is also a contact us page where anyone can send in 
questions using a contact form.
